# Jared's Config Files

This repository contains the config files for my Linux set up. I run Void Linux as my daily driver.

## Features
* XMonad as the windows manager
* Sakura for the terminal emulator
* NeoVim as the text editor
* Fish instead of bash
* Mpd and ncmpcpp for music

## Fast Set-Up
Assuming all dependencies and programs have been installed, run the following commands to link the config files. 

```bash
# change to the home directory
cd ~
# clone repository in the home directory
git clone https://github.com/jaredponn/Jared-s-Config-Files.gi://github.com/jaredponn/Jared-s-Config-Files.git 
# changing directory to the repository
cd Jared-s-Config-Files
# running the file to symlink the config files to this repository
./link.sh
```
